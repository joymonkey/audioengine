# CHIRP Audio Trigger Arduino Sketches
Final code for the CHIRP Audio Trigger and several test sketches live here.

- CHIRP_Audio : this is intended to be the actual functional final code for the CHIRP Audio Trigger Board
- mp3-wav-mix-example : early code to see how feasible mixing a wav with a decoded MP3 would be
- pico-mp3-trigger-251013 : a work in progress sketch using breadboard hardware
- pico-mp3-trigger : earlier version of the above
