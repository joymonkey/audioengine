# RSeries Audio Engine
Hardware and firmware for a new sound file playing/mixing PCB. Perfectly suited for Droid Builder use in an Astromech droid.

Some project goals...
- play and mix multiple audio filetype (initially stereo MP3 and mono WAV)
- also take an external audio input (such as HCR Vocalizer) and mix with gain adjustment
- affordable PCB with minimal easy to source components
- easy to implement in current droid control systems (Padawan/Shadow/Kyber)
- room on the hardware for advanced droid nonsense
